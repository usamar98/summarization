A few months ago I had the opportunity to complete Andrew Ngs Machine Learning MOOC taught on Coursera It serves as a very good introduction for anyone who wants to venture into the world of AI ML But the catch this course is taught in Octave I always wondered how amazing this course could be if it were in Python I finally decided to re-take the course but only this time I would be completing the programming assignments in Python In these series of blog posts I plan to write about the Python version of the programming exercises used in the course Im doing this for a few reasons It will help anyone who wanted a Python version of the course that includes me as well It will hopefully benefit R users who are willing to learn about the Pythonic implementation of the algorithms they are already familiar with Pre-requisites Its highly reommended that first you watch the week 1 video lectures Should have basic familiarity with the Python ecosystem In this section we will look at the simplest Machine Learning algorithms First some context on the problem statement Here we will implement linear regrssion with one variable to predict profits for a food tuck Suppose you are the CEO of a restaurant franchise ad are considering different cities for opening a new outlet The chain already has trucks in various cities and you have data for profits and populations from the cities The file ex1data txt available under week 2s assignment material contains the dataset for our linear regression exercise The first column is the population of a city and the second column is the profit of a food truck ithat city A negative value for profit indicates a loss
